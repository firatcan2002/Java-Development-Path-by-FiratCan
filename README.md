# Java Development Path & Professional Roadmap 🚀 – by @firatcan2002

This repository documents my structured journey to master Core Java and the essential tools for modern Backend development, with a clear focus on the Spring Boot framework.

I am a dedicated Software Engineering student committed to building a strong portfolio for Junior Developer roles in the European market.
